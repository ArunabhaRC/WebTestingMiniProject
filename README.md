## Building Tests:
Testers should follow these stages when writing tests for this website.

1. Testing URL Connection:
    - Checking the URL connection is something that falls under the should test category; by testing this you are able to see if your connection to the website is running correctly and if you are at the correct URL.

2. Testing Website Design:
    - Testing website design is very important as it is what all the users see. It can determine how inclined a user is to reuse the site. Testing things such as if there is a placeholder where text should go allows you to check what the user can see.

    - This can be taken a step further in testing the design of tick boxes, if they work how they are meant to.

    - Drop down menus is also something that effects the design of the website. Can the options given be selected? How many options are there? Is there an option for if none of the other options apply to the user?
